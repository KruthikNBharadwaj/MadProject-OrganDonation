# MadProject-OrganDonation
This project is a Java Based Application. Here we have used Java and XML to build the app. We have used SQLite for storing the database.
This project is a project on organ donation. Here a donor can donate his organs by registering himself for the organ donation program. The donor can donate organs like eyes, kidney, bone marrow and etc.
These information can be viewed only by the admin. Also the admin can delete the record.
For the patient to get these organs planted first he has to register himself and then he can view the information about the donor.
